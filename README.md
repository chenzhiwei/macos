```

```

## Install Cask packages

```

## Setup Ubuntu env

Find a vagrant box from <https://vagrantcloud.com>, suppose the box is `ubuntu/trusty64`.

```
$ brew install Caskroom/cask/vagrant
$ brew install Caskroom/cask/virtualbox
$ mkdir vagrant
$ vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64
$ ls .vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
$ vim Vagrantfile
config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  vb.gui = false
  vb.memory = "4096"
  vb.cpus = "4"
end
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
```

## Clear All DNS Servers

If you update the `/etc/resolv.conf` file or use the GUI to update your DNS servers, it will persist.

The following command can be helpful if you're wanting to fall back to DHCP provided DNS from a router, modem, or similar situation:

```
# networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi empty
# networksetup -setsearchdomains Wi-Fi empty
```
